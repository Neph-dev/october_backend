# News Article System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive news article processing system for the October Backend, featuring RSS feed processing, automated article collection, sentiment analysis, and a full REST API for news retrieval with advanced filtering capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### üì∞ News Article Processing
- **RSS Feed Integration**: Automated RSS feed parsing using `github.com/mmcdole/gofeed`
- **Article Deduplication**: GUID-based deduplication to prevent duplicate articles
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Basic sentiment scoring (-2 to +2 scale)
- **Relevance Scoring**: Company relevance calculation (0.0 to 1.0 scale)
- **Metadata Extraction**: Full article metadata including title, summary, source URL, publication date

### üîç News API Endpoints
- **GET /news**: List articles with comprehensive filtering
- **GET /news/{id}**: Retrieve specific article by ID
- **Rate Limited**: 10 requests/second, burst of 20
- **Advanced Filtering**: Company, date range, sentiment, relevance, pagination

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema
- **MongoDB Integration**: Full MongoDB support with connection pooling
- **Optimized Indexing**: 7 strategic indexes for query performance
- **GUID Uniqueness**: Unique constraint on article GUID for deduplication
- **Compound Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns

### üõ†Ô∏è Command Line Tools
- **Feed Processor**: Process RSS feeds for all or specific companies
- **Article Seeder**: Create test articles for demonstration
- **RSS Tester**: Test RSS feed parsing with various sources

## Technical Implementation

### Domain Architecture
```
internal/domain/news/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models.go          # Article, Filter, and RSSFeedItem structures
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repository.go      # Repository interface for data access
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service.go         # Business logic and validation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ errors.go          # Domain-specific error definitions
```

### Infrastructure Layer
```
internal/infra/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database/mongodb/news_repository.go  # MongoDB implementation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feed/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rss_service.go      # RSS feed parsing
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ processor_service.go # Feed processing orchestration
```

### HTTP Interface
```
internal/interfaces/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ http/handlers/news_handler.go  # HTTP request handling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ http/router.go                 # Updated routing with news endpoints
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dto/news.go                    # Data transfer objects
```

## API Examples

### Basic News Retrieval
```bash
# Get all news
curl "http://localhost:8080/news"

# Get news for specific company
curl "http://localhost:8080/news?company=Lockheed%20Martin"

# Get positive sentiment news
curl "http://localhost:8080/news?sentiment=1"

# Get high relevance news
curl "http://localhost:8080/news?min_relevance=0.9"
```

### Advanced Filtering
```bash
# Date range filtering
curl "http://localhost:8080/news?start_date=2024-10-01&end_date=2024-10-31"

# Complex multi-filter query
curl "http://localhost:8080/news?company=Lockheed%20Martin&sentiment=1&min_relevance=0.8&limit=10"

# Pagination
curl "http://localhost:8080/news?limit=20&offset=40"
```

### Article Retrieval
```bash
# Get specific article
curl "http://localhost:8080/news/68fa496fd8f2980b8c4dd8aa"
```

## Database Schema

### Articles Collection
```javascript
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "title": String,
  "summary": String,
  "source_url": String,
  "companies": [String],
  "published_date": ISODate,
  "sentiment_score": Number,
  "relevance_score": Number,
  "processed_date": ISODate,
  "feed_source": String,
  "content": String,
  "guid": String // Unique index
}
```

### Indexes Created
1. `guid` (unique) - Deduplication
2. `companies` - Company filtering
3. `published_date` - Date sorting
4. `sentiment_score` - Sentiment filtering
5. `relevance_score` - Relevance filtering
6. `feed_source` - Source filtering
7. `companies + published_date` - Compound for common queries

## Make Commands

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Setup and run
make deps           # Install dependencies
make build          # Build all binaries
make seed-data      # Seed company data
make seed-articles  # Seed test articles
make run           # Start server

# RSS Processing
make process-feeds                          # Process all company feeds
make process-feed COMPANY="Lockheed Martin" # Process specific company

# Testing
make test-api      # Test all API endpoints
make test          # Run unit tests
make lint          # Run code linting
