# Web Search Validation Fix

## Issues Fixed

### Problem 1: Case Sensitivity
- **Issue**: Query "Who was the founder of rtx?" (lowercase) was rejected as non-defense related
- **Cause**: Case-sensitive string matching in `isDefenseAeronauticsQuery()`
- **Fix**: Made all company name matching case-insensitive

### Problem 2: Incomplete Defense Company Recognition
- **Issue**: Queries about company founders/history weren't recognized as defense-related
- **Cause**: Limited keyword list didn't include corporate/historical terms
- **Fix**: Expanded keyword list to include: "founder", "ceo", "executive", "leadership", "history", "founded", "established", "company", "corporation", "business"

### Problem 3: Insufficient RTX Recognition
- **Issue**: "RTX" queries weren't always triggering web search
- **Cause**: RTX wasn't consistently mapped to Raytheon Technologies in search enhancement
- **Fix**: Added explicit RTX → Raytheon Technologies mapping in query enhancement

## Technical Changes

### 1. Enhanced `isDefenseAeronauticsQuery()` Function
```go
// Before: Limited keywords, case-sensitive
defenseKeywords := []string{
    "defense", "defence", "military", "aerospace", ...
}

// After: Expanded keywords, case-insensitive validation
defenseKeywords := []string{
    "defense", "defence", "military", "aerospace", "aeronautics", "aviation",
    "aircraft", "fighter", "missile", "radar", "satellite", "contract",
    "pentagon", "air force", "navy", "army", "marines", "weapons",
    "jet", "helicopter", "drone", "uav", "defense contract", "founder",
    "ceo", "executive", "leadership", "history", "founded", "established",
    "company", "corporation", "business", "industry", "technology",
}
```

### 2. New Helper Functions
- `isDefenseCompany(company string) bool`: Case-insensitive defense company validation
- `isAboutDefenseCompany(lowerQuery string) bool`: Detects mentions of known defense companies

### 3. Enhanced Query Enhancement
```go
// Added RTX → Raytheon mapping
if strings.Contains(lowerQuery, "rtx") && !strings.Contains(lowerQuery, "raytheon") {
    enhanced = fmt.Sprintf("%s Raytheon Technologies", enhanced)
}
```

## Test Cases Now Supported

✅ **Corporate History Queries**:
- "Who was the founder of RTX?"
- "Who was the founder of rtx?" (lowercase)
- "Who founded Raytheon Technologies?"
- "When was RTX established?"
- "RTX company history"

✅ **Leadership Queries**:
- "Who is the CEO of RTX?"
- "RTX executive leadership"
- "Raytheon executives"

✅ **Case Variations**:
- "rtx", "RTX", "Rtx" all work consistently
- "raytheon", "Raytheon", "RAYTHEON" all work

❌ **Still Rejected (Correctly)**:
- "Who founded Apple Inc?" (non-defense)
- "Best pizza recipes" (non-defense)
- Consumer/non-defense company queries

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test:
```bash
./scripts/test_rtx_founder_fix.sh
```

This test verifies:
1. RTX founder queries (both cases) trigger web search
2. Direct web search accepts RTX queries
3. Non-defense queries are still properly rejected
4. Full AI pipeline works with founder queries

## Impact

- **Improved User Experience**: Founder/history questions about defense companies now work
- **Case Insensitive**: Users don't need to worry about exact capitalization
- **Better RTX Support**: RTX queries are enhanced with "Raytheon Technologies" for better search results
- **Maintained Security**: Non-defense queries are still properly filtered out
